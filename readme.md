# IJN Monorepo ðŸ•´

This monorepo is a starter for an Expo + Next.js app using [NativeWind](https://nativewind.dev) for its styling & [Solito](https://solito.dev) for navigation.

## ðŸ‘“ How NativeWind works with Solito

### Fast on every platform

NativeWind lets you use Tailwind while reducing runtime work on every platform.

### iOS and Android

Most approaches to using Tailwind in React Native do something like this at runtime:

## Notes
1. Install


## ðŸ“¦ Included packages

- `solito` for cross-platform navigation
- `moti` for animations
- `nativewind` for theming/design (you can bring your own, too)
- Expo SDK 49
- Next.js 13
- Expo Router 2

## ðŸ—‚ Folder layout

- `apps` entry points for each app

  - `expo`
  - `app` you'll be creating files inside of `apps/expo/app` to use file system routing on iOS and Android.
  - `next`

- `packages` shared packages across apps
  - `app` you'll be importing most files from `app/`
    - `features` (don't use a `screens` folder. organize by feature.)
    - `provider` (all the providers that wrap the app, and some no-ops for Web.)
    - `design` your app's design system. organize this as you please.
      - `typography` (components for all the different text styles)
      - `layout` (components for layouts)

You can add other folders inside of `packages/` if you know what you're doing and have a good reason to.
